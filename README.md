During creating the project I faced with three main questions: 
1) Where to store all data? 
2) Where to host the project?
3) Project design? 

That was good points to improve my skills and knowledges, because before this project I had only theoretical knwoledge:
- Creating a database architecture. (tables / data types and their formats, table connections / pk /fk).
- Ability to host the project to 3d party service.
- As I have some experience in Figma, I made from scratch unique design for the project. [LINK]
