During developing of tis project, I encountered main challenges:

1. Data storage. Where to store all data?
2. Hosting. Where to host the project?
3. Design. How to do design the user interface?

These challenges provided an excellent opportunity to enhance my skills, as prior to this project, my knowledge was mostly theoretical. I had to tackle practical aspects such as:

- Designing the database architecture (creating tables, defining data types and formats, establishing table relationships, primary and foreign keys).
- Deploying the project to a third-party hosting service.
- Utilizing my experience with Figma, I created a unique design for the project from scratch. [LINK]
